About me
=====
I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I have developed a keen interest in RF-Wave circuits design and quantum information science.

Having completed my undergraduate studies, I am actively seeking research opportunities to further delve into the field of integrated circuit design.
