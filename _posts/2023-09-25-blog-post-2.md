# MOS Device Physics
Switch
Threshold Voltage
I/V Characteristics - overdrive voltage, aspect ratio, pinched off, 
#### Unlike bipolar transistors, a MOS device may be on even if it carries no current.
#### Since the mobility of holes is about ½ the mobility of electrons, PMOS devices suffer from lower “current drive” capability.
#### NMOS current sources inject current into ground while PMOS current sources draws current from VDD
Transconductance
#### Drain current and overdrive voltage are bias values
Second-Order Effects - subthreshold conduction
#### if the length L is doubled, the slope of ID vs. VDS is divided by four
MOS Device Layout
Capacitances
Small-Signal Model
