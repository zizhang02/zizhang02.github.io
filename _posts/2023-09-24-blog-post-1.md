This is a template blog for reference.

Motivation
======
Sort out my own study and life, share what I have learned, and hope to inspire others. 

Thoughts at the moment
------
I've been going to record what I've learned and thought about every day in a relatively concise, systematic way for a long time. And I've tried it offline, but the problem is that I haven't taken into account the feelings of the reviewers.<br>
Now, I have finally explored this simple and convenient way to make my daily records online (in fact, it is forced by the needs of the application season).  I aspire to efficiently input information and generate effective outputs in the future, making gradual improvements each day. Additionally, I hope for a smooth application season.
